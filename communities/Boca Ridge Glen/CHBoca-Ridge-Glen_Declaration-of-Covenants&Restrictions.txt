In addition, the Owner of the adjoining property (not within the Properties) may grant the . Association, its duly authorized agents, employees, or independent contrac- tors, such easements for ingress and egress across its properties to effect and perform the exterior maintenance aforementioned. In such event, the Association shall indemnify any such adjoining property Owner for any damage or injury to the easement areas caused by the use thereof for access to perform the exterior maintenance.

Written notice of the assessment shall thereupon be sent to every Owner subject thereto. The Association shall, upon demand at any time, furnish to any Owner liable for an assessment a certificate in writing signed by an officer of the | Association, setting forth whether such assessment has been paid as to the - Lot owned by the Owner making request therefor. Such certificate shall be | conclusive evidence of payment of any assessment to the Association therein - stated to have been paid. .

If the assessments are not paid on the date when due (being the date speci- fied in Section 6 hereof), then such assessments shall become delinquent and shall, together with such interest thereon and the cost of collection thereof as herein provided, thereupon become a continuing lien on the property which shall bind such property in the hands of the Owner, his heirs, devisees, personal representatives, successors and assigns. Any individual who ac- quires title to a Lot upon the death of an Owner or by operation of law shall . be personally liable for unpaid assessments with respect of such Lot. In any voluntary conveyance, the grantee shall be jointly and severally liable with the grantor for all unpaid assessments made prior to the time of such vol- untary conveyance, without prejudice to the rights of the grantee to recover from the Grantor the amounts paid by the grantee therefor. If the assessment is not paid within thirty (30) days after the due date, the assessment shall bear interest from the date when due at the rate of eighteen (18%) percent per annum and the Association may bring an action at law against the Owner personally obligated to pay the same or may record a claim of lien against the property on which the assessment is unpaid and may foreclose the lien against the property on which the assessment is unpaid, in like manner as a foreclosure of a mortgage on real property, or pursue one -8- === PAGE 10 === | ; | or more of such remedies at the same time or successively, and there shall be | added to the amount of such assessment, attorneys‚Äô fees and costs of prepar- | ing and filing the claim of lien and the complaint in such action, and in the | event a judgment is obtained, such judgment shall include interest on the assessment as above provided and a reasonable attorneys' fee to be fixed by the court together with the costs of the action, and the Association shall be entitled to attorneys' fees in connection with any appeal of any such action. It shall be the legal duty and responsibility of the Association to enforce | payment of the assessments hereunder. Section 9. Subordination of the Lien to Mortgages.
