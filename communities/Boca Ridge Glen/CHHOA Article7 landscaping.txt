LANDSCAPING

CHAPTER A GENERAL
 **
Section 1 Purpose and Intent This Article provides general direction and establishes minimum standards related to the following: [Ord. 2018-002]

A. Design principles to ensure compliance with the Managed Growth Tier System (MGTS); [Ord. 2018-002]

B. Review process and decision-making standards for the evaluation of Landscape Plans; [Ord. 2018-002]

C. Requirements for buffers, interior, and other service areas of a property; [Ord. 2018-002]

D. Standards for plant materials and other landscape barriers or structures; [Ord. 2018-002]

E. Preservation of existing native vegetation, elimination of prohibited, and reduction of controlled plant

species; [Ord. 2018-002]

F. Installation and continued maintenance; and, [Ord. 2018-002]

G. Enforcement of the Code requirements. [Ord. 2018-002]

Section 2 MGTS Compliance Landscape design shall comply with the relevant MGTS characteristics in both plant material selection and overall
landscape composition. [Ord. 2018-002]

A. U/S Tier

Landscaping in the U/S Tier should have a higher level of detail and more structure, such as pedestrian accents, formal or meandering arrangements in perimeter landscape buffers, street tree plantings, and
interconnections between pedestrian and vehicular areas. The WCRAO, IRO, and URAO, among others, serve to promote urbanized forms of development that accommodate walkability and other attributes of the
urban environment. Greater flexibility and alternative landscape solutions are available to promote development within the boundaries of these areas. [Ord. 2010-005] [Ord. 2010-022] [Ord. 2014-025] [Ord.
2018-002]

B. AGR and Glades Tiers

Landscaping in the AGR and Glades Tiers should consist of large open spaces with equestrian and
agricultural elements, and an increased percentage of üå± [NATIVE PLANTS] native plant species. [Ord. 2018-002]

C. Exurban and Rural Tiers

Landscaping in the Exurban and Rural Tiers should incorporate more informal design patterns that include:
reduced impervious areas; preservation of native vegetation; and, more naturalistic landscaped areas. Non- residential uses shall accommodate increased amounts of landscape materials in the parking areas and
building foundation plantings. [Ord. 2009-040] [Ord. 2018-002] Section 3 Landscape Design Principles
This Section establishes standards for landscape design. It is the intent of this Article to encourage creativity in landscape design while providing general direction and criteria for the evaluation of a specific type of plan: Planting,
Landscape, or ALP in order to issue a Landscape Permit. The following design principles are general standards to be applied by the Applicant, and used by the DRO and other County Agencies in evaluating whether the proposed
Landscape Plans are in compliance with the requirements of this Article: [Ord. 2009-040] [Ord. 2018-002]

A. Appearance and Composition

To improve the aesthetic appearance of development through creative landscaping that helps to enhance the natural and built environment. [Ord. 2018-002]
The quality of landscape design is dependent upon the quantity, selection, and arrangement of plant materials. Landscape materials should be designed in a manner as to provide the following qualities and
characteristics: [Ord. 2018-002]

1. Texture

Landscape designs should provide a textured appearance through the use of a variety of plant materials with varying leaf sizes, textures, and height. Formal landscape designs benefit from a uniform spacing
of plants, whereas varied spacing and clustering of trees is more compatible with a naturalistic design.
[Ord. 2018-002] Unified Land Development Code Article 7 ‚Äì Landscaping
Supplement No. 32 (Printed 12/24) Page 7

=== PAGE 8 ===
2. Color

Landscape designs should include a variety of plants that provide contrasting colors. Designs should include a mix of plants that flower throughout the year. [Ord. 2018-002]

3. Form

Landscape designs should consider the complete three-dimensional form of the landscaping, not simply the form of individual elements. The interrelationship of all landscape elements, whether they
are plant materials, shade structures, pavement, and amenities should be considered so that the final design presents a coherent whole. Trees, shrubs, and hedges, especially those used for screening and
buffering, should display a fullness at maturity that is typical of the species. [Ord. 2018-002]

B. Environmental Quality

To improve the environment by maintaining permeable land area essential to surface water management;
reducing and reversing air, noise, heat, and chemical pollution through the biological filtering capacities of vegetation; promoting energy conservation through the creation of shade; and, reducing heat gain in or on
buildings or paved areas. [Ord. 2018-002]

1. Energy Conservation and Sustainable Design

Attention should be given to locating landscape elements in a manner that provides energy conservation benefits. Landscape designs should also consider natural drainage features and the use
of pervious surfaces and areas to minimize runoff.

C. üö∞ [WATER CONSERVATION] Water Conservation

To promote üö∞ [WATER CONSERVATION] water conservation by encouraging: the installation of native and drought-tolerant plant materials in appropriate areas; the use of water conserving irrigation practices; and, the adherence to
landscape installation standards and maintenance procedures that promote üö∞ [WATER CONSERVATION] water conservation. [Ord.
2018-002]

1. Use of Native and Drought-Resistant Plants

Landscape designs should feature üå± [NATIVE PLANTS] native plant species, especially in areas adjacent to existing native vegetation. Where feasible, the reestablishment of native habitats should be incorporated into the
landscape design. The use of drought-tolerant plants should enrich the existing landscape character, conserve water and energy, and provide as pleasant and varied a visual appearance as plants that
require more water. [Ord. 2018-002]

D. Preservation of Existing Native Vegetation and Removal of Prohibited Plant Species

To encourage the preservation and planting of native vegetation as part of landscape design and eradicate prohibited species. [Ord. 2018-002]

1. Incorporation of Existing Vegetation

Landscape designs should incorporate and enhance existing specimen trees and native vegetation.
Particular care should be given to preserve intact natural landscapes. Where previous landscaping has dramatically altered natural landscapes, new designs should seek to reestablish natural landscape
patterns and plantings. Landscape designs should also include the eradication of prohibited plant species that have become nuisances because of their tendency to disrupt or destroy native
ecosystems. [Ord. 2018-002]

E. Compatibility

To promote efficiency in the development of limited land resources by improving the compatibility of adjacent incompatible land uses, particularly residential development that is adjacent to non-residential
development, through the use of landscape buffers. [Ord. 2018-002]

1. Screening and Buffering

Whenever possible landscape materials should be utilized to provide a spatial transition between different land uses; buffering between adjacent properties; and, screening for parking, storage areas,
or other service areas. Plants may be used with fences, walls, or berms to achieve the desired screening or buffering effect. Plant material should be mature enough at the time of planting to provide
an effective screen or buffer, and should be planted in an appropriate location to allow for desired growth within a reasonable period of time. [Ord. 2018-002]

F. Quality Pedestrian Environment

In the U/S Tier, as well as pedestrian-oriented development types such as TDDs, landscape designs should give special attention to ensuring a safe and visually pleasant pedestrian environment. In high activity areas,
such as commercial and workplace areas, benches, kiosks, artwork, and other streetscape elements should be incorporated into landscape designs. Pedestrian access to sidewalks or buildings should be considered
in all landscape designs. Landscaping shall not obstruct pedestrian sightlines, especially at crosswalks.
[Ord. 2018-002] Unified Land Development Code Article 7 ‚Äì Landscaping
Supplement No. 32 (Printed 12/24) Page 8

=== PAGE 9 ===
G. Enhancing Architecture

Landscape designs should be compatible with and enhance the architectural character and features of the
buildings on site, and help relate the building to the surrounding landscape. Plant material shall be installed at an appropriate size and allowed to accomplish these intended goals. When foundation planting is
required, plantings and planters should incorporate artistic elements and be compatible with a building‚Äôs architectural character. [Ord. 2018-002]

2. Irreparable/Irreversible Harm

For a violation that is deemed irreparable or irreversible damage to the vegetation, the violation shall
be corrected by the removal of the damaged vegetation and stump, and replacement of the vegetation utilizing one or a combination of the following two options: [Ord. 2020-001]
a. Additional Quantity Option Utilize Table 7.G.3.C, Violation of Vegetation Replacement to establish the quantity and the
individual replacement size pursuant to Art. 7.D.2, Trees, Palms, and Pines. This option may
require planting additional trees, palms, or pines. [Ord. 2020-001] 1) If the property has a prior approved Landscape Plan, ALP, or a DO that depicts the location of
the vegetation, the approval shall be revised to show the new location of the additional vegetation. [Ord. 2020-001]
2) If the property is subject to Conditions of Approval requiring larger size trees, palms, or pines, the size of the replacement vegetation shall be in compliance with the conditions, and the
vegetation shall be installed in the same or approximate location where the original vegetation was shown on the approved Landscape Plan or ALP. If additional vegetation is required to be
planted on the property as a result of this option, then additional sanctions will be placed. [Ord.
2020-001] 3) If a tree or pine is removed with only the stump remaining, the following formula shall be utilized
to determine the size of the removed tree or pine. [Ord. 2019-005] a) measure the diameter of the tree or pine stump and reduce the measurement by 25
percent; and [Ord. 2019-005] b) replacement of the quantity of the tree or pine shall be based on the reduced diameter
measurement, and subject to, the requirements of Table 7.G.3.C, Violation of Vegetation Replacement for estimating the number of trees or pines to be replaced. [Ord. 2019-005]
[Ord. 2020-001] Table 7.G.3.C ‚Äì Violation of Vegetation Replacement
Tree or Pine Diameter at 4.5‚Äô Quantity for Credits or for
Above Grade (1)(2)(3) Replacements < 2‚Äù = 2
2-6‚Äù = 3 7-11‚Äù = 4
12-16‚Äù = 5 17-21‚Äù = 6
22-26‚Äù = 7 27-31‚Äù = 8
32-36‚Äù = 9 ‚â• 37‚Äù = 10
[Ord. 2020-001] Notes:
Fractional measurements shall be rounded in accordance with Art. 1.C.1.A.2, Interpretation and Application. [Ord. 2020-001]
Pines with a diameter of six inches or more, measured at a height of four and one-half feet above grade shall be subject to preservation, mitigation, or replacement. [Ord. 2020-001]

3. Quantity: replacement of palms shall be one for one. [Ord. 2020-001]

b. Same Quantity and Larger Size Option The option allows the Property Owner to install larger size vegetation to replace irreparable or
irreversible vegetation. The replacement quantity may be one for one only if the size of each replacement tree, palm, or pine exceeds the minimum size by 20 percent of the size indicated in
Art. 7.D.2, Trees, Palms, and Pines. If there are prior Conditions of Approval requiring larger size vegetation, then the replacement vegetation shall comply with the conditions. [Ord. 2020-001]

D. Additional Sanctions

PBC may take any appropriate legal action, including, but not limited to requiring replacement of landscape material which has been hatracked, damaged, and rendered unable to achieve its natural and intended
form, administrative action, requests for temporary and permanent injunctions, and other sanctions to enforce the provisions of this Section. [Ord. 2005-002]
