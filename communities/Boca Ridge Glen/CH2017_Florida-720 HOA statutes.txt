720.302 Purposes, scope, and application.‚Äî (1) The purposes of this chapter are to give statutory recognition to corporations not for profit that operate residential communities in this state, to
provide procedures for operating homeowners‚Äô associations, and to protect the rights of association members without unduly impairing the ability of such associations to perform their functions.
(2) The Legislature recognizes that it is not in the best interest of homeowners‚Äô associations or the individual association members thereof to create or impose a bureau or other agency of state government to regulate the affairs of homeowners‚Äô associations. However, in accordance with s. 720.311, the
Legislature finds that homeowners‚Äô associations and their individual members will benefit from an expedited alternative process for resolution of election and recall disputes and presuit mediation of other disputes involving covenant enforcement and authorizes the department to hear, administer, and
determine these disputes as more fully set forth in this chapter. Further, the Legislature recognizes that certain contract rights have been created for the
benefit of homeowners‚Äô associations and members thereof before the effective date of this act and that ss. 720.301-720.407 are not intended to impair such contract rights, including, but not limited to, the rights of the developer to complete the community as initially contemplated.
(3) This chapter does not apply to:
(a) A community that is composed of property primarily intended for commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential use; or

incorporated into this chapter for the purpose of regulating homeowners‚Äô associations.
(5) Unless expressly stated to the contrary, corporations that operate residential homeowners‚Äô associations in this state shall be governed by and
subject to part I of chapter 607, if the association was incorporated under that part, or to chapter 617, if the association was incorporated under that chapter, and this chapter. This subsection is intended to clarify existing law.

720.303 Association powers and duties; meetings of board; official records; budgets; üí∞ [FINANCIAL REPORTING] financial reporting; association funds; recalls.‚Äî (1) POWERS AND DUTIES.‚ÄîAn association which operates a community as defined in s. 720.301, must be operated by an association that is a Florida
corporation. After October 1, 1995, the association must be incorporated and the initial governing documents must be recorded in the official records of the county in which the community is located. An association may operate more than one community. The officers and directors of an association have a
fiduciary relationship to the members who are served by the association. The powers and duties of an association include those set forth in this chapter and, except as expressly limited or restricted in this chapter, those set forth in the governing documents. After control of the association is obtained by
members other than the developer, the association may institute, maintain, settle, or appeal actions or hearings in its name on behalf of all members concerning matters of common interest to the members, including, but not limited to, the common areas; roof or structural components of a building, or
other improvements for which the association is responsible; mechanical, electrical, or plumbing elements serving an improvement or building for which the association is responsible; representations of the developer pertaining to any existing or proposed commonly used facility; and protesting ad valorem
taxes on commonly used facilities. The association may defend actions in eminent domain or bring inverse condemnation actions. Before commencing litigation against any party in the name of the association involving amounts in controversy in excess of $100,000, the association must obtain the
affirmative approval of a majority of the voting interests at a meeting of the membership at which a üë• [QUORUM] quorum has been attained. This subsection does not limit any statutory or common-law right of any individual member or class of members to bring any action without participation by the association. A
member does not have authority to act for the association by virtue of being a member. An association may have more than one class of members and
may issue membership certificates. An association of 15 or fewer parcel owners may enforce only the requirements of those deed restrictions established prior to the purchase of each parcel upon an affected parcel owner or owners.

(2) BOARD MEETINGS.‚Äî

(a) A meeting of the board of directors of an association occurs whenever a üë• [QUORUM] quorum of the board gathers to conduct association business. Meetings of the board must be open to all members, except for meetings between the board and its attorney with respect to proposed or pending litigation where
the contents of the discussion would otherwise be governed by the attorney-client privilege. A meeting of the board must be held at a location that is accessible to a physically handicapped person if requested by a physically handicapped person who has a right to attend the meeting. The provisions of
this subsection shall also apply to the meetings of any committee or other similar body when a final decision will be made regarding the expenditure of association funds and to meetings of any body vested with the power to approve or disapprove architectural decisions with respect to a specific parcel of
residential property owned by a member of the community.
(b) Members have the right to attend all meetings of the board. The right to attend such meetings includes the right to speak at such meetings with reference to all designated items. The association may adopt written reasonable rules expanding the right of members to speak and governing the

6/22/2018 Statutes & Constitution :View Statutes : Online Sunshine frequency, duration, and other manner of member statements, which rules must be consistent with this paragraph and may include a sign-up sheet for
members wishing to speak. Notwithstanding any other law, meetings between the board or a committee and the association‚Äôs attorney to discuss proposed or pending litigation or meetings of the board held for the purpose of discussing personnel matters are not required to be open to the members
other than directors.
(c) The bylaws shall provide for giving notice to parcel owners and members of all board meetings and, if they do not do so, shall be deemed to provide the following:

1. Notices of all board meetings must be posted in a conspicuous place in the community at least 48 hours in advance of a meeting, except in an

emergency. In the alternative, if notice is not posted in a conspicuous place in the community, notice of each board meeting must be mailed or delivered to each member at least 7 days before the meeting, except in an emergency. Notwithstanding this general notice requirement, for communities with
more than 100 members, the bylaws may provide for a reasonable alternative to posting or mailing of notice for each board meeting, including publication of notice, provision of a schedule of board meetings, or the conspicuous posting and repeated broadcasting of the notice on a closed-circuit
cable television system serving the homeowners‚Äô association. However, if broadcast notice is used in lieu of a notice posted physically in the community, the notice must be broadcast at least four times every broadcast hour of each day that a posted notice is otherwise required. When broadcast notice is
provided, the notice and agenda must be broadcast in a manner and for a sufficient continuous length of time so as to allow an average reader to observe the notice and read and comprehend the entire content of the notice and the agenda. The association may provide notice by electronic transmission in a
manner authorized by law for meetings of the board of directors, committee meetings requiring notice under this section, and annual and special meetings of the members; however, a member must consent in writing to receiving notice by electronic transmission.

2. An assessment may not be levied at a board meeting unless the notice of the meeting includes a statement that assessments will be considered

and the nature of the assessments. Written notice of any meeting at which special assessments will be considered or at which amendments to rules regarding parcel use will be considered must be mailed, delivered, or electronically transmitted to the members and parcel owners and posted
conspicuously on the property or broadcast on closed-circuit cable television not less than 14 days before the meeting.

3. Directors may not vote by proxy or by secret ballot at board meetings, except that secret ballots may be used in the election of officers. This

subsection also applies to the meetings of any committee or other similar body, when a final decision will be made regarding the expenditure of association funds, and to any body vested with the power to approve or disapprove architectural decisions with respect to a specific parcel of residential
property owned by a member of the community.
(d) If 20 percent of the total voting interests petition the board to address an item of business, the board shall at its next regular board meeting or at a special meeting of the board, but not later than 60 days after the receipt of the petition, take the petitioned item up on an agenda. The board shall
give all members notice of the meeting at which the petitioned item shall be addressed in accordance with the 14-day notice requirement pursuant to subparagraph (c)2. Each member shall have the right to speak for at least 3 minutes on each matter placed on the agenda by petition, provided that the
member signs the sign-up sheet, if one is provided, or submits a written request to speak prior to the meeting. Other than addressing the petitioned item at the meeting, the board is not obligated to take any other action requested by the petition.
(3) MINUTES.‚ÄîMinutes of all meetings of the members of an association and of the board of directors of an association must be maintained in written form or in another form that can be converted into written form within a reasonable time. A vote or abstention from voting on each matter voted upon
for each director present at a board meeting must be recorded in the minutes.

electronically via the Internet or by allowing the records to be viewed in electronic format on a computer screen and printed upon request. If the
association has a photocopy machine available where the records are maintained, it must provide parcel owners with copies on request during the
inspection if the entire request is limited to no more than 25 pages. An association shall allow a member or his or her authorized representative to use a portable device, including a smartphone, tablet, portable scanner, or any other technology capable of scanning or taking photographs, to make an

6/22/2018 Statutes & Constitution :View Statutes : Online Sunshine (a) The failure of an association to provide access to the records within 10 business days after receipt of a written request submitted by certified
mail, return receipt requested, creates a rebuttable presumption that the association willfully failed to comply with this subsection.
(b) A member who is denied access to official records is entitled to the actual damages or minimum damages for the association‚Äôs willful failure to comply with this subsection. The minimum damages are to be $50 per calendar day up to 10 days, the calculation to begin on the 11th business day after
receipt of the written request.
(c) The association may adopt reasonable written rules governing the frequency, time, location, notice, records to be inspected, and manner of inspections, but may not require a parcel owner to demonstrate any proper purpose for the inspection, state any reason for the inspection, or limit a
parcel owner‚Äôs right to inspect records to less than one 8-hour business day per month. The association may impose fees to cover the costs of providing copies of the official records, including the costs of copying and the costs required for personnel to retrieve and copy the records if the time spent
retrieving and copying the records exceeds one-half hour and if the personnel costs do not exceed $20 per hour. Personnel costs may not be charged for
records requests that result in the copying of 25 or fewer pages. The association may charge up to 25 cents per page for copies made on the association‚Äôs photocopier. If the association does not have a photocopy machine available where the records are kept, or if the records requested to be copied exceed
25 pages in length, the association may have copies made by an outside duplicating service and may charge the actual cost of copying, as supported by the vendor invoice. The association shall maintain an adequate number of copies of the recorded governing documents, to ensure their availability to
members and prospective members. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the following records are not accessible to members or parcel owners:

1. Any record protected by the lawyer-client privilege as described in s. 90.502 and any record protected by the work-product privilege, including,

but not limited to, a record prepared by an association attorney or prepared at the attorney‚Äôs express direction which reflects a mental impression, conclusion, litigation strategy, or legal theory of the attorney or the association and which was prepared exclusively for civil or criminal litigation or for

proceedings.

2. Information obtained by an association in connection with the approval of the lease, sale, or other transfer of a parcel.

3. Personnel records of association or management company employees, including, but not limited to, disciplinary, payroll, health, and insurance

4. Medical records of parcel owners or community residents.

5. Social security numbers, driver license numbers, credit card numbers, electronic mailing addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers,

emergency contact information, any addresses for a parcel owner other than as provided for association notice requirements, and other personal identifying information of any person, excluding the person‚Äôs name, parcel designation, mailing address, and property address. Notwithstanding the
restrictions in this subparagraph, an association may print and distribute to parcel owners a directory containing the name, parcel address, and all telephone numbers of each parcel owner. However, an owner may exclude his or her telephone numbers from the directory by so requesting in writing to
the association. An owner may consent in writing to the disclosure of other contact information described in this subparagraph. The association is not liable for the disclosure of information that is protected under this subparagraph if the information is included in an official record of the association and
is voluntarily provided by an owner and not requested by the association.

6. Any electronic security measure that is used by the association to safeguard data, including passwords.

The association or its authorized agent may charge a reasonable fee to the prospective purchaser or lienholder or the current parcel owner or member for providing good faith
responses to requests for information by or on behalf of a prospective purchaser or lienholder, other than that required by law, if the fee does not exceed $150 plus the reasonable cost of photocopying and any attorney fees incurred by the association in connection with the response.

(6) BUDGETS.‚Äî

(a) The association shall prepare an annual budget that sets out the annual operating expenses. The budget must reflect the estimated revenues and
expenses for that year and the estimated surplus or deficit as of the end of the current year. The budget must set out separately all fees or charges paid for by the association for recreational amenities, whether owned by the association, the developer, or another person. The association shall provide each
member with a copy of the annual budget or a written notice that a copy of the budget is available upon request at no charge to the member. The copy must be provided to the member within the time limits set forth in subsection (5).
(b) In addition to annual operating expenses, the budget may include üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts for capital expenditures and deferred maintenance for which the association is responsible. If üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts are not established pursuant to paragraph (d), funding of such üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves is limited to the extent that the
governing documents limit increases in assessments, including üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves. If the budget of the association includes üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts established pursuant to paragraph (d), such üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves shall be determined, maintained, and waived in the manner provided in this subsection. Once an association provides for
üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts pursuant to paragraph (d), the association shall thereafter determine, maintain, and waive üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves in compliance with this subsection.
This section does not preclude the termination of a üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve account established pursuant to this paragraph upon approval of a majority of the total voting interests of the association. Upon such approval, the terminating üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve account shall be removed from the budget.
(c)1. If the budget of the association does not provide for üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts pursuant to paragraph (d) and the association is responsible for the repair and maintenance of capital improvements that may result in a special assessment if üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves are not provided, each üí∞ [FINANCIAL REPORTING] financial report for the preceding
fiscal year required by subsection (7) must contain the following statement in conspicuous type:
THE BUDGET OF THE ASSOCIATION DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR üè¶ [RESERVES] RESERVE ACCOUNTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT MAY
RESULT IN SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS. OWNERS MAY ELECT TO PROVIDE FOR üè¶ [RESERVES] RESERVE ACCOUNTS PURSUANT TO SECTION 720.303(6), FLORIDA STATUTES,
** UPON OBTAINING THE APPROVAL OF A MAJORITY OF THE TOTAL VOTING INTERESTS OF THE ASSOCIATION BY VOTE OF THE MEMBERS AT A MEETING OR
 **
BY WRITTEN CONSENT.

2. If the budget of the association does provide for funding accounts for deferred expenditures, including, but not limited to, funds for capital

expenditures and deferred maintenance, but such accounts are not created or established pursuant to paragraph (d), each üí∞ [FINANCIAL REPORTING] financial report for the
preceding fiscal year required under subsection (7) must also contain the following statement in conspicuous type:
THE BUDGET OF THE ASSOCIATION PROVIDES FOR LIMITED VOLUNTARY DEFERRED EXPENDITURE ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE, SUBJECT TO LIMITS ON FUNDING CONTAINED IN OUR GOVERNING DOCUMENTS. BECAUSE THE OWNERS HAVE NOT ELECTED
TO PROVIDE FOR üè¶ [RESERVES] RESERVE ACCOUNTS PURSUANT TO SECTION 720.303(6), FLORIDA STATUTES, THESE FUNDS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS
ON USE OF SUCH FUNDS SET FORTH IN THAT STATUTE, NOR ARE üè¶ [RESERVES] RESERVES CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT STATUTE.
(d) An association is deemed to have provided for üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts if üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts have been initially established by the developer or if the
membership of the association affirmatively elects to provide for üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves. If üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts are established by the developer, the budget must
designate the components for which the üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts may be used. If üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts are not initially provided by the developer, the membership of http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0720/0720.html 8/48

obtained by vote of the members at a duly called meeting of the membership or by the written consent of a majority of the total voting interests of the
association. The approval action of the membership must state that üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts shall be provided for in the budget and must designate the
components for which the üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts are to be established. Upon approval by the membership, the board of directors shall include the required üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts in the budget in the next fiscal year following the approval and each year thereafter. Once established as provided in this subsection,
the üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts must be funded or maintained or have their funding waived in the manner provided in paragraph (f).
(e) The amount to be üè¶ [RESERVES] reserved in any account established shall be computed by means of a formula that is based upon estimated remaining useful life and estimated replacement cost or deferred maintenance expense of each üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve item. The association may adjust replacement üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve
assessments annually to take into account any changes in estimates of cost or useful life of a üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve item.
(f) After one or more üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts are established, the membership of the association, upon a majority vote at a meeting at which a üë• [QUORUM] quorum is present, may provide for no üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves or less üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves than required by this section. If a meeting of the unit owners has been called to determine whether
to waive or reduce the funding of üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves and such result is not achieved or a üë• [QUORUM] quorum is not present, the üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves as included in the budget go into effect. After the turnover, the developer may vote its voting interest to waive or reduce the funding of üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves. Any vote taken pursuant to this
subsection to waive or reduce üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves is applicable only to one budget year.
(g) Funding formulas for üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves authorized by this section must be based on a separate analysis of each of the required assets or a pooled analysis of two or more of the required assets.

1. If the association maintains separate üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve accounts for each of the required assets, the amount of the contribution to each üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve account is

the sum of the following two calculations:
a. The total amount necessary, if any, to bring a negative component balance to zero.
b. The total estimated deferred maintenance expense or estimated replacement cost of the üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve component less the estimated balance of the
üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve component as of the beginning of the period the budget will be in effect. The remainder, if greater than zero, shall be divided by the estimated remaining useful life of the component.
The formula may be adjusted each year for changes in estimates and deferred maintenance performed during the year and may include factors such as inflation and earnings on invested funds.

2. If the association maintains a pooled account of two or more of the required üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve assets, the amount of the contribution to the pooled üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve

account as disclosed on the proposed budget may not be less than that required to ensure that the balance on hand at the beginning of the period the
budget will go into effect plus the projected annual cash inflows over the remaining estimated useful life of all of the assets that make up the üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve pool are equal to or greater than the projected annual cash outflows over the remaining estimated useful lives of all the assets that make up the üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve
pool, based on the current üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve analysis. The projected annual cash inflows may include estimated earnings from investment of principal and accounts receivable minus the allowance for doubtful accounts. The üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve funding formula may not include any type of balloon payments.
(h) üè¶ [RESERVES] Reserve funds and any interest accruing thereon shall remain in the üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve account or accounts and shall be used only for authorized üè¶ [RESERVES] reserve expenditures unless their use for other purposes is approved in advance by a majority vote at a meeting at which a üë• [QUORUM] quorum is present. Prior to turnover
of control of an association by a developer to parcel owners, the developer-controlled association shall not vote to use üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves for purposes other than those for which they were intended without the approval of a majority of all nondeveloper voting interests voting in person or by limited proxy at a duly
called meeting of the association.

presentation before a governmental entity on matters related to the homeowners‚Äô association. However, it is the public policy of this state that government entities, business organizations, and individuals not engage in SLAPP suits because such actions are inconsistent with the right of parcel
owners to participate in the state‚Äôs institutions of government. Therefore, the Legislature finds and declares that prohibiting such lawsuits by governmental entities, business entities, and individuals against parcel owners who address matters concerning their homeowners‚Äô association will
püè¶ [RESERVES] reserve this fundamental state policy, püè¶ [RESERVES] reserve the constitutional rights of parcel owners, and assure the continuation of representative government in this state. It is the intent of the Legislature that such lawsuits be expeditiously disposed of by the courts.
(a) As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúgovernmental entity‚Äù means the state, including the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, the independent establishments of the state, counties, municipalities, districts, authorities, boards, or commissions, or any agencies of
these branches which are subject to chapter 286.
(b) A governmental entity, business organization, or individual in this state may not file or cause to be filed through its employees or agents any lawsuit, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, or counterclaim against a parcel owner without merit and solely because such parcel owner has exercised
the right to instruct his or her representatives or the right to petition for redress of grievances before the various governmental entities of this state, as protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and s. 5, Art. I of the State Constitution.
(c) A parcel owner sued by a governmental entity, business organization, or individual in violation of this section has a right to an expeditious resolution of a claim that the suit is in violation of this section. A parcel owner may petition the court for an order dismissing the action or granting final
judgment in favor of that parcel owner. The petitioner may file a motion for summary judgment, together with supplemental affidavits, seeking a determination that the governmental entity‚Äôs, business organization‚Äôs, or individual‚Äôs lawsuit has been brought in violation of this section. The
governmental entity, business organization, or individual shall thereafter file its response and any supplemental affidavits. As soon as practicable, the
court shall set a hearing on the petitioner‚Äôs motion, which shall be held at the earliest possible time after the filing of the governmental entity‚Äôs, business organization‚Äôs or individual‚Äôs response. The court may award the parcel owner sued by the governmental entity, business organization, or
individual actual damages arising from the governmental entity‚Äôs, individual‚Äôs, or business organization‚Äôs violation of this section. A court may treble the
damages awarded to a prevailing parcel owner and shall state the basis for the treble damages award in its judgment. The court shall award the
prevailing party reasonable attorney‚Äôs fees and costs incurred in connection with a claim that an action was filed in violation of this section.
(d) Homeowners‚Äô associations may not expend association funds in prosecuting a SLAPP suit against a parcel owner.

association and the member under this section, in addition to recovering his or her reasonable attorney fees, may recover additional amounts as determined by the court to be necessary to reimburse the member for his or her share of assessments levied by the association to fund its expenses of
the litigation. This relief does not exclude other remedies provided by law. This section does not deprive any person of any other available right or
remedy.
(2) The association may levy reasonable fines. A fine may not exceed $100 per violation against any member or any member‚Äôs tenant, guest, or
invitee for the failure of the owner of the parcel or its occupant, licensee, or invitee to comply with any provision of the declaration, the association bylaws, or reasonable rules of the association unless otherwise provided in the governing documents. A fine may be levied by the board for each day of a
continuing violation, with a single notice and opportunity for hearing, except that the fine may not exceed $1,000 in the aggregate unless otherwise provided in the governing documents. A fine of less than $1,000 may not become a lien against a parcel. In any action to recover a fine, the prevailing
party is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs from the nonprevailing party as determined by the court.
(a) An association may suspend, for a reasonable period of time, the right of a member, or a member‚Äôs tenant, guest, or invitee, to use common areas and facilities for the failure of the owner of the parcel or its occupant, licensee, or invitee to comply with any provision of the declaration, the
association bylaws, or reasonable rules of the association. This paragraph does not apply to that portion of common areas used to provide access or
utility services to the parcel. A suspension may not prohibit an owner or tenant of a parcel from having vehicular and pedestrian ingress to and egress from the parcel, including, but not limited to, the right to park.
(b) A fine or suspension may not be imposed by the board of administration without at least 14 days‚Äô notice to the person sought to be fined or
suspended and an opportunity for a hearing before a committee of at least three members appointed by the board who are not officers, directors, or

does not approve a proposed fine or suspension, it may not be imposed. The role of the committee is limited to determining whether to confirm or reject the fine or suspension levied by the board. If the board of administration imposes a fine or suspension, the association must provide written notice of
such fine or suspension by mail or hand delivery to the parcel owner and, if applicable, to any tenant, licensee, or invitee of the parcel owner.
(3) If a member is more than 90 days delinquent in paying any fee, fine, or other monetary obligation due to the association, the association may
suspend the rights of the member, or the member‚Äôs tenant, guest, or invitee, to use common areas and facilities until the fee, fine, or other monetary obligation is paid in full. This subsection does not apply to that portion of common areas used to provide access or utility services to the parcel. A
suspension may not prohibit an owner or tenant of a parcel from having vehicular and pedestrian ingress to and egress from the parcel, including, but not limited to, the right to park.

(4) An association may suspend the voting rights of a parcel or member for the nonpayment of any fee, fine, or other monetary obligation due to the
association that is more than 90 days delinquent. A voting interest or consent right allocated to a parcel or member which has been suspended by the
association shall be subtracted from the total number of voting interests in the association, which shall be reduced by the number of suspended voting interests when calculating the total percentage or number of all voting interests available to take or approve any action, and the suspended voting
interests shall not be considered for any purpose, including, but not limited to, the percentage or number of voting interests necessary to constitute a üë• [QUORUM] quorum, the percentage or number of voting interests required to conduct an election, or the percentage or number of voting interests required to
approve an action under this chapter or pursuant to the governing documents. The notice and hearing requirements under subsection (2) do not apply to a suspension imposed under this subsection. The suspension ends upon full payment of all obligations currently due or overdue to the association.
(5) All suspensions imposed pursuant to subsection (3) or subsection (4) must be approved at a properly noticed board meeting. Upon approval, the
association must notify the parcel owner and, if applicable, the parcel‚Äôs occupant, licensee, or invitee by mail or hand delivery.
(6) The suspensions permitted by paragraph (2)(a) and subsections (3) and (4) apply to a member and, when appropriate, the member‚Äôs tenants, guests, or invitees, even if the delinquency or failure that resulted in the suspension arose from less than all of the multiple parcels owned by a member.

If a contract for the purchase, lease, or renting of materials or equipment,

720.306 Meetings of members; voting and election procedures; amendments.‚Äî

(1) üë• [QUORUM] QUORUM; AMENDMENTS.‚Äî

(a) Unless a lower number is provided in the bylaws, the percentage of voting interests required to constitute a üë• [QUORUM] quorum at a meeting of the members shall be 30 percent of the total voting interests. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter or in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, decisions that
require a vote of the members must be made by the concurrence of at least a majority of the voting interests present, in person or by proxy, at a meeting at which a üë• [QUORUM] quorum has been attained. A meeting of the members must be held at a location that is accessible to a physically handicapped person
if requested by a physically handicapped person who has a right to attend the meeting.
(b) Unless otherwise provided in the governing documents or required by law, and other than those matters set forth in paragraph (c), any governing document of an association may be amended by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the voting interests of the association. Within 30 days after
recording an amendment to the governing documents, the association shall provide copies of the amendment to the members. However, if a copy of the
proposed amendment is provided to the members before they vote on the amendment and the proposed amendment is not changed before the vote, the
association, in lieu of providing a copy of the amendment, may provide notice to the members that the amendment was adopted, identifying the official book and page number or instrument number of the recorded amendment and that a copy of the amendment is available at no charge to the member
upon written request to the association. The copies and notice described in this paragraph may be provided electronically to those owners who previously consented to receive notice electronically. The failure to timely provide notice of the recording of the amendment does not affect the validity or
enforceability of the amendment.
(c) Unless otherwise provided in the governing documents as originally recorded or permitted by this chapter or chapter 617, an amendment may not materially and adversely alter the proportionate voting interest appurtenant to a parcel or increase the proportion or percentage by which a parcel
shares in the common expenses of the association unless the record parcel owner and all record owners of liens on the parcels join in the execution of the amendment. For purposes of this section, a change in üë• [QUORUM] quorum requirements is not an alteration of voting interests. The merger or consolidation of
one or more associations under a plan of merger or consolidation under part I of chapter 607 or chapter 617 is not a material or adverse alteration of the
proportionate voting interest appurtenant to a parcel.
(d) The Legislature finds that the procurement of mortgagee consent to amendments that do not affect the rights or interests of mortgagees is an unreasonable and substantial logistical and financial burden on the parcel owners and that there is a compelling state interest in enabling the members
of an association to approve amendments to the association‚Äôs governing documents through legal means. Accordingly, and notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary:

1. As to any mortgage recorded on or after July 1, 2013, any provision in the association‚Äôs governing documents that requires the consent or joinder

of some or all mortgagees of parcels or any other portion of the association‚Äôs common areas to amend the association‚Äôs governing documents or for any other matter is enforceable only as to amendments to the association‚Äôs governing documents that adversely affect the priority of the mortgagee‚Äôs lien or
the mortgagee‚Äôs rights to foreclose its lien or that otherwise materially affect the rights and interests of the mortgagees.

2. As to mortgages recorded before July 1, 2013, any existing provisions in the association‚Äôs governing documents requiring mortgagee consent are

enforceable.

3. In securing consent or joinder, the association is entitled to rely upon the public records to identify the holders of outstanding mortgages. The

association may use the address provided in the original recorded mortgage document, unless there is a different address for the holder of the mortgage in a recorded assignment or modification of the mortgage, which recorded assignment or modification must reference the official records book and page

6/22/2018 Statutes & Constitution :View Statutes : Online Sunshine on which the original mortgage was recorded. Once the association has identified the recorded mortgages of record, the association shall, in writing,
request of each parcel owner whose parcel is encumbered by a mortgage of record any information that the owner has in his or her possession regarding the name and address of the person to whom mortgage payments are currently being made. Notice shall be sent to such person if the address provided in
the original recorded mortgage document is different from the name and address of the mortgagee or assignee of the mortgage as shown by the public record. The association is deemed to have complied with this requirement by making the written request of the parcel owners required under this
subparagraph. Any notices required to be sent to the mortgagees under this subparagraph shall be sent to all available addresses provided to the
association.

4. Any notice to the mortgagees required under subparagraph 3. may be sent by a method that establishes proof of delivery, and any mortgagee who

fails to respond within 60 days after the date of mailing is deemed to have consented to the amendment.

5. For those amendments requiring mortgagee consent on or after July 1, 2013, in the event mortgagee consent is provided other than by properly

recorded joinder, such consent shall be evidenced by affidavit of the association recorded in the public records of the county in which the declaration is recorded.

6. Any amendment adopted without the required consent of a mortgagee is voidable only by a mortgagee who was entitled to notice and an

opportunity to consent. An action to void an amendment is subject to the statute of limitations beginning 5 years after the date of discovery as to the
amendments described in subparagraph 1. and 5 years after the date of recordation of the certificate of amendment for all other amendments. This subparagraph applies to all mortgages, regardless of the date of recordation of the mortgage.
(2) ANNUAL MEETING.‚ÄîThe association shall hold a meeting of its members annually for the transaction of any and all proper business at a time, date, and place stated in, or fixed in accordance with, the bylaws. The election of directors, if one is required to be held, must be held at, or in
conjunction with, the annual meeting or as provided in the governing documents.
(3) SPECIAL MEETINGS.‚ÄîSpecial meetings must be held when called by the board of directors or, unless a different percentage is stated in the
governing documents, by at least 10 percent of the total voting interests of the association. Business conducted at a special meeting is limited to the
purposes described in the notice of the meeting.
(4) CONTENT OF NOTICE.‚ÄîUnless law or the governing documents require otherwise, notice of an annual meeting need not include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Notice of a special meeting must include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the
meeting is called.
(5) NOTICE OF MEETINGS.‚ÄîThe bylaws shall provide for giving notice to members of all member meetings, and if they do not do so shall be deemed to provide the following: The association shall give all parcel owners and members actual notice of all membership meetings, which shall be mailed,
delivered, or electronically transmitted to the members not less than 14 days prior to the meeting. Evidence of compliance with this 14-day notice shall
be made by an affidavit executed by the person providing the notice and filed upon execution among the official records of the association. In addition to mailing, delivering, or electronically transmitting the notice of any meeting, the association may, by reasonable rule, adopt a procedure for
conspicuously posting and repeatedly broadcasting the notice and the agenda on a closed-circuit cable television system serving the association. When broadcast notice is provided, the notice and agenda must be broadcast in a manner and for a sufficient continuous length of time so as to allow an
average reader to observe the notice and read and comprehend the entire content of the notice and the agenda.
(6) RIGHT TO SPEAK.‚ÄîMembers and parcel owners have the right to attend all membership meetings and to speak at any meeting with reference to all items opened for discussion or included on the agenda. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the governing documents or any rules adopted
by the board or by the membership, a member and a parcel owner have the right to speak for at least 3 minutes on any item. The association may adopt http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0720/0720.html 21/48

business that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting may be transacted at the adjourned meeting. If a new record date for the
adjourned meeting is or must be fixed under s. 607.0707, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to persons who are entitled to vote and are members as of the new record date but were not members as of the previous record date.
(8) PROXY VOTING.‚ÄîThe members have the right, unless otherwise provided in this subsection or in the governing documents, to vote in person or by proxy.
(a) To be valid, a proxy must be dated, must state the date, time, and place of the meeting for which it was given, and must be signed by the
authorized person who executed the proxy. A proxy is effective only for the specific meeting for which it was originally given, as the meeting may
lawfully be adjourned and reconvened from time to time, and automatically expires 90 days after the date of the meeting for which it was originally given. A proxy is revocable at any time at the pleasure of the person who executes it. If the proxy form expressly so provides, any proxy holder may
appoint, in writing, a substitute to act in his or her place.
(b) If the governing documents permit voting by secret ballot by members who are not in attendance at a meeting of the members for the election of directors, such ballots must be placed in an inner envelope with no identifying markings and mailed or delivered to the association in an outer envelope
bearing identifying information reflecting the name of the member, the lot or parcel for which the vote is being cast, and the signature of the lot or
parcel owner casting that ballot. If the eligibility of the member to vote is confirmed and no other ballot has been submitted for that lot or parcel, the
inner envelope shall be removed from the outer envelope bearing the identification information, placed with the ballots which were personally cast, and
opened when the ballots are counted. If more than one ballot is submitted for a lot or parcel, the ballots for that lot or parcel shall be disqualified. Any vote by ballot received after the closing of the balloting may not be considered.

(9) ELECTIONS AND BOARD VACANCIES.‚Äî

(a) Elections of directors must be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the governing documents of the association. Except as provided in paragraph (b), all members of the association are eligible to serve on the board of directors, and a member may nominate himself or herself
as a candidate for the board at a meeting where the election is to be held; provided, however, that if the election process allows candidates to be nominated in advance of the meeting, the association is not required to allow nominations at the meeting. An election is not required unless more
candidates are nominated than vacancies exist. Except as otherwise provided in the governing documents, boards of directors must be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by eligible voters. Any challenge to the election process must be commenced within 60 days after the election results are
announced.
(b) A person who is delinquent in the payment of any fee, fine, or other monetary obligation to the association on the day that he or she could last nominate himself or herself or be nominated for the board may not seek election to the board, and his or her name shall not be listed on the ballot. A
person serving as a board member who becomes more than 90 days delinquent in the payment of any fee, fine, or other monetary obligation to the
association shall be deemed to have abandoned his or her seat on the board, creating a vacancy on the board to be filled according to law. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ‚Äúany fee, fine, or other monetary obligation‚Äù means any delinquency to the association with respect to any parcel. A person
who has been convicted of any felony in this state or in a United States District or Territorial Court, or has been convicted of any offense in another jurisdiction which would be considered a felony if committed in this state, may not seek election to the board and is not eligible for board membership

bylaws, any vacancy occurring on the board before the expiration of a term may be filled by an affirmative vote of the majority of the remaining directors, even if the remaining directors constitute less than a üë• [QUORUM] quorum, or by the sole remaining director. In the alternative, a board may hold an
election to fill the vacancy, in which case the election procedures must conform to the requirements of the governing documents. Unless otherwise provided in the bylaws, a board member appointed or elected under this section is appointed for the unexpired term of the seat being filled. Filling
vacancies created by recall is governed by s. 720.303(10) and rules adopted by the division.

720.3075 Prohibited clauses in association documents.‚Äî (1) It is declared that the public policy of this state prohibits the inclusion or enforcement of certain types of clauses in homeowners‚Äô association
documents, including declaration of covenants, articles of incorporation, bylaws, or any other document of the association which binds members of the
association, which either have the effect of or provide that:
(a) A developer has the unilateral ability and right to make changes to the homeowners‚Äô association documents after the transition of homeowners‚Äô association control in a community from the developer to the nondeveloper members, as set forth in s. 720.307, has occurred.
(b) A homeowners‚Äô association is prohibited or restricted from filing a lawsuit against the developer, or the homeowners‚Äô association is otherwise effectively prohibited or restricted from bringing a lawsuit against the developer.
(c) After the transition of homeowners‚Äô association control in a community from the developer to the nondeveloper members, as set forth in s.
720.307, has occurred, a developer is entitled to cast votes in an amount that exceeds one vote per residential lot.
Such clauses are declared null and void as against the public policy of this state.
(2) The public policy described in subsection (1) prohibits the inclusion or enforcement of such clauses created on or after the effective date of s. 3, chapter 98-261, Laws of Florida.
(3) Homeowners‚Äô association documents, including declarations of covenants, articles of incorporation, or bylaws, may not preclude the display of one portable, removable United States flag by property owners. However, the flag must be displayed in a respectful manner, consistent with Title 36
U.S.C. chapter 10.
(4)(a) The Legislature finds that the use of Florida-friendly landscaping and other water use and pollution prevention measures to conserve or protect the state‚Äôs water resources serves a compelling public interest and that the participation of homeowners‚Äô associations and local governments is essential
to the state‚Äôs efforts in water conservation and water quality protection and restoration.
(b) Homeowners‚Äô association documents, including declarations of covenants, articles of incorporation, or bylaws, may not prohibit or be enforced so as to prohibit any property owner from implementing Florida-friendly landscaping, as defined in s. 373.185, on his or her land or create any requirement

issued pursuant to part II of chapter 373.
(5) It is declared the public policy of the state that prior to transition of control of a homeowners‚Äô association in a community from the developer to the nondeveloper members, as set forth in s. 720.307, the right of the developer to amend the association‚Äôs governing documents is subject to a test of
reasonableness, which prohibits the developer from unilaterally making amendments to the governing documents that are arbitrary, capricious, or in bad faith; destroy the general plan of development; prejudice the rights of existing nondeveloper members to use and enjoy the benefits of common
property; or materially shift economic burdens from the developer to the existing nondeveloper members.

6/22/2018 Statutes & Constitution :View Statutes : Online Sunshine (b) While the developer is in control of the homeowners‚Äô association, it may be excused from payment of its share of the operating expenses and
assessments related to its parcels for any period of time for which the developer has, in the declaration, obligated itself to pay any operating expenses incurred that exceed the assessments receivable from other members and other income of the association.
(c) Assessments or contingent assessments may be levied by the board of directors of the association to secure the obligation of the homeowners‚Äô association for insurance acquired from a self-insurance fund authorized and operating pursuant to s. 624.462.
(d) This section does not apply to an association, no matter when created, if the association is created in a community that is included in an effective development-of-regional-impact development order as of October 1, 1995, together with any approved modifications thereto.

(2) GUARANTEES OF COMMON EXPENSES.‚Äî

(a) Establishment of a guarantee.‚ÄîIf a guarantee of the assessments of parcel owners is not included in the purchase contracts or declaration, any agreement establishing a guarantee shall only be effective upon the approval of a majority of the voting interests of the members other than the
developer. Approval shall be expressed at a meeting of the members voting in person or by limited proxy or by agreement in writing without a meeting if provided in the bylaws. Such guarantee must meet the requirements of this section.
(b) Guarantee period.‚ÄîThe period of time for the guarantee shall be indicated by a specific beginning and ending date or event.

1. The ending date or event shall be the same for all of the members of an association, including members in different phases of the development.

2. The guarantee may provide for different intervals of time during a guarantee period with different dollar amounts for each such interval.

3. The guarantee may provide that after the initial stated period, the developer has an option to extend the guarantee for one or more additional

stated periods. The extension of a guarantee is limited to extending the ending date or event; therefore, the developer does not have the option of changing the level of assessments guaranteed.
(3) MAXIMUM LEVEL OF ASSESSMENTS.‚ÄîThe stated dollar amount of the guarantee shall be an exact dollar amount for each parcel identified in the
declaration. Regardless of the stated dollar amount of the guarantee, assessments charged to a member shall not exceed the maximum obligation of the
member based on the total amount of the adopted budget and the member‚Äôs proportionate share of the expenses as described in the governing documents.
(4) CASH FUNDING REQUIREMENTS DURING GUARANTEE.‚ÄîThe cash payments required from the guarantor during the guarantee period shall be determined as follows:
(a) If at any time during the guarantee period the funds collected from member assessments at the guaranteed level and other revenues collected by the association are not sufficient to provide payment, on a timely basis, of all assessments, including the full funding of the üè¶ [RESERVES] reserves unless properly
waived, the guarantor shall advance sufficient cash to the association at the time such payments are due.
(b) Expenses incurred in the production of nonassessment revenues, not in excess of the nonassessment revenues, shall not be included in the
assessments. If the expenses attributable to nonassessment revenues exceed nonassessment revenues, only the excess expenses must be funded by the
guarantor. Interest earned on the investment of association funds may be used to pay the income tax expense incurred as a result of the investment; such expense shall not be charged to the guarantor; and the net investment income shall be retained by the association. Each such nonassessment-revenue-
generating activity shall be considered separately. Any portion of the parcel assessment which is budgeted for designated capital contributions of the
association shall not be used to pay operating expenses.
(5) CALCULATION OF GUARANTOR‚ÄôS FINAL OBLIGATION.‚ÄîThe guarantor‚Äôs total financial obligation to the association at the end of the guarantee period shall be determined on the accrual basis using the following formula: the guarantor shall pay any deficits that exceed the guaranteed amount, less
the total regular periodic assessments earned by the association from the members other than the guarantor during the guarantee period regardless of whether the actual level charged was less than the maximum guaranteed amount.

720.3085 Payment for assessments; lien claims.‚Äî (1) When authorized by the governing documents, the association has a lien on each parcel to secure the payment of assessments and other amounts
provided for by this section. Except as otherwise set forth in this section, the lien is effective from and shall relate back to the date on which the original declaration of the community was recorded. However, as to first mortgages of record, the lien is effective from and after recording of a claim of lien in
the public records of the county in which the parcel is located. This subsection does not bestow upon any lien, mortgage, or certified judgment of record on July 1, 2008, including the lien for unpaid assessments created in this section, a priority that, by law, the lien, mortgage, or judgment did not have
before July 1, 2008.
(a) To be valid, a claim of lien must state the description of the parcel, the name of the record owner, the name and address of the association, the
assessment amount due, and the due date. The claim of lien secures all unpaid assessments that are due and that may accrue subsequent to the
recording of the claim of lien and before entry of a certificate of title, as well as interest, late charges, and reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred by the association incident to the collection process. The person making payment is entitled to a satisfaction of the lien upon payment in full.
(b) By recording a notice in substantially the following form, a parcel owner or the parcel owner‚Äôs agent or attorney may require the association to enforce a recorded claim of lien against his or her parcel:
**

this notice. Executed this day of , (year) .

After the notice of a contest of lien has been recorded, the clerk of the circuit court shall mail a copy of the recorded notice to the association by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the address shown in the claim of lien or the most recent amendment to it and shall certify to the service on
the face of the notice. Service is complete upon mailing. After service, the association has 90 days in which to file an action to enforce the lien and, if the action is not filed within the 90-day period, the lien is void. However, the 90-day period shall be extended for any length of time that the association
is prevented from filing its action because of an automatic stay resulting from the filing of a bankruptcy petition by the parcel owner or by any other person claiming an interest in the parcel.

(e) If the parcel owner remains in possession of the parcel after a foreclosure judgment has been entered, the court may require the parcel owner to pay a reasonable rent for the parcel. If the parcel is rented or leased during the pendency of the foreclosure action, the association is entitled to the
appointment of a receiver to collect the rent. The expenses of the receiver must be paid by the party who does not prevail in the foreclosure action.
(f) The association may purchase the parcel at the foreclosure sale and hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the parcel.
(2)(a) A parcel owner, regardless of how his or her title to property has been acquired, including by purchase at a foreclosure sale or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, is liable for all assessments that come due while he or she is the parcel owner. The parcel owner‚Äôs liability for assessments may not be
avoided by waiver or suspension of the use or enjoyment of any common area or by abandonment of the parcel upon which the assessments are made.
(b) A parcel owner is jointly and severally liable with the previous parcel owner for all unpaid assessments that came due up to the time of transfer of title. This liability is without prejudice to any right the present parcel owner may have to recover any amounts paid by the present owner from the
previous owner. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ‚Äúprevious owner‚Äù shall not include an association that acquires title to a delinquent property through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure. The present parcel owner‚Äôs liability for unpaid assessments is limited to any unpaid
assessments that accrued before the association acquired title to the delinquent property through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure.

6/22/2018 Statutes & Constitution :View Statutes : Online Sunshine (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section, the liability of a first mortgagee, or its successor or assignee as a subsequent
holder of the first mortgage who acquires title to a parcel by foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure for the unpaid assessments that became due before the mortgagee‚Äôs acquisition of title, shall be the lesser of:

1. The parcel‚Äôs unpaid common expenses and regular periodic or special assessments that accrued or came due during the 12 months immediately

preceding the acquisition of title and for which payment in full has not been received by the association; or

2. One percent of the original mortgage debt.

The limitations on first mortgagee liability provided by this paragraph apply only if the first mortgagee filed suit against the parcel owner and initially joined the association as a defendant in the mortgagee foreclosure action. Joinder of the association is not required if, on the date the complaint is
filed, the association was dissolved or did not maintain an office or agent for service of process at a location that was known to or reasonably discoverable by the mortgagee.
(d) An association, or its successor or assignee, that acquires title to a parcel through the foreclosure of its lien for assessments is not liable for any unpaid assessments, late fees, interest, or reasonable attorney‚Äôs fees and costs that came due before the association‚Äôs acquisition of title in favor of any
other association, as defined in s. 718.103(2) or s. 720.301(9), which holds a superior lien interest on the parcel. This paragraph is intended to clarify existing law.
(3) Assessments and installments on assessments that are not paid when due bear interest from the due date until paid at the rate provided in the
declaration of covenants or the bylaws of the association, which rate may not exceed the rate allowed by law. If no rate is provided in the declaration or
bylaws, interest accrues at the rate of 18 percent per year.
(a) If the declaration or bylaws so provide, the association may also charge an administrative late fee not to exceed the greater of $25 or 5 percent of the amount of each installment that is paid past the due date.
(b) Any payment received by an association and accepted shall be applied first to any interest accrued, then to any administrative late fee, then to any costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in collection, and then to the delinquent assessment. This paragraph applies notwithstanding any
restrictive endorsement, designation, or instruction placed on or accompanying a payment. A late fee is not subject to the provisions of chapter 687 and
is not a fine.
(4) A homeowners‚Äô association may not file a record of lien against a parcel for unpaid assessments unless a written notice or demand for past due assessments as well as any other amounts owed to the association pursuant to its governing documents has been made by the association. The written
notice or demand must:
(a) Provide the owner with 45 days following the date the notice is deposited in the mail to make payment for all amounts due, including, but not limited to, any attorney‚Äôs fees and actual costs associated with the preparation and delivery of the written demand.

1. The association must provide the tenant a notice, by hand delivery or United States mail, in substantially the following form:

Pursuant to section 720.3085(8), Florida Statutes, we demand that you make your rent payments directly to the homeowners‚Äô association and
continue doing so until the association notifies you otherwise.
Payment due the homeowners‚Äô association may be in the same form as you paid your landlord and must be sent by United States mail or hand
delivery to (full address) , payable to (name) .
Your obligation to pay your rent to the association begins immediately, unless you have already paid rent to your landlord for the current period before receiving this notice. In that case, you must provide the association written proof of your payment within 14 days after receiving this notice
and your obligation to pay rent to the association would then begin with the next rental period.
Pursuant to section 720.3085(8), Florida Statutes, your payment of rent to the association gives you complete immunity from any claim for the
rent by your landlord.

2. A tenant is immune from any claim by the parcel owner related to the rent timely paid to the association after the association has made written

demand.
(b) If the tenant paid rent to the landlord or parcel owner for a given rental period before receiving the demand from the association and provides written evidence to the association of having paid the rent within 14 days after receiving the demand, the tenant shall begin making rental payments to
the association for the following rental period and shall continue making rental payments to the association to be credited against the monetary obligations of the parcel owner until the association releases the tenant or the tenant discontinues tenancy in the unit. The association shall, upon
request, provide the tenant with written receipts for payments made. The association shall mail written notice to the parcel owner of the association‚Äôs demand that the tenant pay monetary obligations to the association.
(c) The liability of the tenant may not exceed the amount due from the tenant to the tenant‚Äôs landlord. The tenant shall be given a credit against rents due to the landlord in the amount of assessments paid to the association.
(d) The association may issue notice under s. 83.56 and sue for eviction under ss. 83.59-83.625 as if the association were a landlord under part II of chapter 83 if the tenant fails to pay a monetary obligation. However, the association is not otherwise considered a landlord under chapter 83 and
specifically has no obligations under s. 83.51.
(e) The tenant does not, by virtue of payment of monetary obligations, have any of the rights of a parcel owner to vote in any election or to examine the books and records of the association.
(f) A court may supersede the effect of this subsection by appointing a receiver.

(2) If the governing documents provide for the cost of communications services as defined in s. 202.11, information services or Internet services obtained pursuant to a bulk contract shall be deemed an operating expense of the association. If the governing documents do not provide for such
services, the board may contract for the services, and the cost shall be deemed an operating expense of the association but must be allocated on a per- parcel basis rather than a percentage basis, notwithstanding that the governing documents provide for other than an equal sharing of operating expenses.

(b) Any contract entered into by the board must provide, and shall be deemed to provide if not expressly set forth therein, that a hearing-impaired or legally blind parcel owner who does not occupy the parcel with a non-hearing-impaired or sighted person, or a parcel owner who receives
supplemental security income under Title XVI of the Social Security Act or food assistance as administered by the Department of Children and Families pursuant to s. 414.31, may discontinue the service without incurring disconnect fees, penalties, or subsequent service charges, and may not be required
to pay any operating expenses charge related to such service for those parcels. If fewer than all parcel owners share the expenses of the communications services, information services, or Internet services, the expense must be shared by all participating parcel owners.

located outside the community but within the same franchised, licensed, or certificated area, and except for installation charges agreed to between the
resident and the service provider.

accordance with the applicable Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, and these proceedings are privileged and confidential to the same extent as court- ordered mediation. Disputes subject to presuit mediation under this section shall not include the collection of any assessment, fine, or other financial
obligation, including attorney‚Äôs fees and costs, claimed to be due or any action to enforce a prior mediation settlement agreement between the parties.
Also, in any dispute subject to presuit mediation under this section where emergency relief is required, a motion for temporary injunctive relief may be filed with the court without first complying with the presuit mediation requirements of this section. After any issues regarding emergency or temporary
relief are resolved, the court may either refer the parties to a mediation program administered by the courts or require mediation under this section. An arbitrator or judge may not consider any information or evidence arising from the presuit mediation proceeding except in a proceeding to impose
sanctions for failure to attend a presuit mediation session or to enforce a mediated settlement agreement. Persons who are not parties to the dispute may not attend the presuit mediation conference without the consent of all parties, except for counsel for the parties and a corporate representative
designated by the association. When mediation is attended by a üë• [QUORUM] quorum of the board, such mediation is not a board meeting for purposes of notice and
participation set forth in s. 720.303. An aggrieved party shall serve on the responding party a written demand to participate in presuit mediation in substantially the following form:
**
STATUTORY OFFER TO PARTICIPATE

IN PRESUIT MEDIATION
 **
The alleged aggrieved party, , hereby demands that , as the responding party, engage in mandatory presuit mediation in connection with the
following disputes, which by statute are of a type that are subject to presuit mediation:
(List specific nature of the dispute or disputes to be mediated and the authority supporting a finding of a violation as to each dispute.)
Pursuant to section 720.311, Florida Statutes, this demand to resolve the dispute through presuit mediation is required before a lawsuit can be filed concerning the dispute. Pursuant to the statute, the parties are required to engage in presuit mediation with a neutral third-party mediator in order
to attempt to resolve this dispute without court action, and the aggrieved party demands that you likewise agree to this process. If you fail to participate in the mediation process, suit may be brought against you without further warning.
The process of mediation involves a supervised negotiation process in which a trained, neutral third-party mediator meets with both parties and
assists them in exploring possible opportunities for resolving part or all of the dispute. By agreeing to participate in presuit mediation, you are not bound in any way to change your position. Furthermore, the mediator has no authority to make any decisions in this matter or to determine who is
right or wrong and merely acts as a facilitator to ensure that each party understands the position of the other party and that all options for
reasonable settlement are fully explored.
If an agreement is reached, it shall be reduced to writing and becomes a binding and enforceable commitment of the parties. A resolution of one or
more disputes in this fashion avoids the need to litigate these issues in court. The failure to reach an agreement, or the failure of a party to participate in the process, results in the mediator declaring an impasse in the mediation, after which the aggrieved party may proceed to court on
all outstanding, unsettled disputes. If you have failed or refused to participate in the entire mediation process, you will not be entitled to recover attorney‚Äôs fees, even if you prevail.

6/22/2018 Statutes & Constitution :View Statutes : Online Sunshine The aggrieved party has selected and hereby lists five certified mediators who we believe to be neutral and qualified to mediate the dispute. You
have the right to select any one of these mediators. The fact that one party may be familiar with one or more of the listed mediators does not mean that the mediator cannot act as a neutral and impartial facilitator. Any mediator who cannot act in this capacity is required ethically to decline to
accept engagement. The mediators that we suggest, and their current hourly rates, are as follows:
(List the names, addresses, telephone numbers, and hourly rates of the mediators. Other pertinent information about the background of the
mediators may be included as an attachment.)
You may contact the offices of these mediators to confirm that the listed mediators will be neutral and will not show any favoritism toward either party. The Florida Supreme Court can provide you a list of certified mediators.
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, section 720.311(2)(b), Florida Statutes, requires that the parties share the costs of presuit mediation equally, including the fee charged by the mediator. An average mediation may require three to four hours of the mediator‚Äôs time, including some preparation
time, and the parties would need to share equally the mediator‚Äôs fees as well as their own attorney‚Äôs fees if they choose to employ an attorney in connection with the mediation. However, use of an attorney is not required and is at the option of each party. The mediators may require the
advance payment of some or all of the anticipated fees. The aggrieved party hereby agrees to pay or prepay one-half of the mediator‚Äôs estimated fees and to forward this amount or such other reasonable advance deposits as the mediator requires for this purpose. Any funds deposited will be
returned to you if these are in excess of your share of the fees incurred.
To begin your participation in presuit mediation to try to resolve the dispute and avoid further legal action, please sign below and clearly indicate which mediator is acceptable to you. We will then ask the mediator to schedule a mutually convenient time and place for the mediation conference
to be held. The mediation conference must be held within ninety (90) days of this date, unless extended by mutual written agreement. In the event that you fail to respond within 20 days from the date of this letter, or if you fail to agree to at least one of the mediators that we have suggested or
to pay or prepay to the mediator one-half of the costs involved, the aggrieved party will be authorized to proceed with the filing of a lawsuit against you without further notice and may seek an award of attorney‚Äôs fees or costs incurred in attempting to obtain mediation.
Therefore, please give this matter your immediate attention. By law, your response must be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, and
by first-class mail to the address shown on this demand.
RESPONDING PARTY: YOUR SIGNATURE INDICATES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THAT CHOICE.

The response shall be served by certified mail, return receipt requested, with an additional copy being
sent by regular first-class mail, to the address shown on the statutory demand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, once the parties have agreed on a mediator, the mediator may reschedule the mediation for a date and time mutually convenient to the parties. The parties shall share the costs of presuit
mediation equally, including the fee charged by the mediator, if any, unless the parties agree otherwise, and the mediator may require advance payment of its reasonable fees and costs. The failure of any party to respond to a demand or response, to agree upon a mediator, to make payment of fees and
costs within the time established by the mediator, or to appear for a scheduled mediation session without the approval of the mediator, shall constitute the failure or refusal to participate in the mediation process and shall operate as an impasse in the presuit mediation by such party, entitling the other
party to proceed in court and to seek an award of the costs and fees associated with the mediation. Additionally, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law or document, persons who fail or refuse to participate in the entire mediation process may not recover attorney‚Äôs fees and costs in subsequent
litigation relating to the dispute. If any presuit mediation session cannot be scheduled and conducted within 90 days after the offer to participate in mediation was filed, an impasse shall be deemed to have occurred unless both parties agree to extend this deadline.
(c) If presuit mediation as described in paragraph (a) is not successful in resolving all issues between the parties, the parties may file the unresolved dispute in a court of competent jurisdiction or elect to enter into binding or nonbinding arbitration pursuant to the procedures set forth in s. 718.1255
and rules adopted by the division, with the arbitration proceeding to be conducted by a department arbitrator or by a private arbitrator certified by the
department. If all parties do not agree to arbitration proceedings following an unsuccessful presuit mediation, any party may file the dispute in court. A final order resulting from nonbinding arbitration is final and enforceable in the courts if a complaint for trial de novo is not filed in a court of competent
jurisdiction within 30 days after entry of the order. As to any issue or dispute that is not resolved at presuit mediation, and as to any issue that is settled at presuit mediation but is thereafter subject to an action seeking enforcement of the mediation settlement, the prevailing party in any subsequent
arbitration or litigation proceeding shall be entitled to seek recovery of all costs and attorney‚Äôs fees incurred in the presuit mediation process.
(d) A mediator or arbitrator shall be authorized to conduct mediation or arbitration under this section only if he or she has been certified as a circuit court civil mediator or arbitrator, respectively, pursuant to the requirements established by the Florida Supreme Court.
